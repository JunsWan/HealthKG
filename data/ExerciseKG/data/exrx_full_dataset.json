    "Comments": "This exercise may be prescribed for functional forward head posture since it strengthens Splenius without neck flexion . Neck retraction primarily consists of Cervical Flexion (spine) accompanied by subtle Thoracic Flexion (spine) and Neck Flexion (atlanto-occipital joint). Cervical spine has natural lordotic curvature (see diagram of spine ). Much of the retraction motion is actually flattening or slight reversing the normal lordosis. The deep neck flexors perform majority of movement. Slight neck Flexion at the atlanto-occipital joint also occurs to maintain forward head positioning. See video with close up view .

Execution Keeping body straight, bring handles toward top of shoulders by flexing arms, while keeping elbows pointed forward. Return by straightening arms and repeat.",
    "Comments": "Dismounting can be achieved by walking backward until body is upright. Also referred to as Suspended Biceps Curl, arguably somewhat of a misnomer as applied to form shown here. The positioning of arms, with elbows high, places short head (medial head) of Bicep Brachii in active insufficiency as arm continues to flex. The long head of Biceps Brachii (lateral head) and in particular, Brachialis are primary movers in this position. Compare to Suspended Biceps Curl . Allowing elbows to drop slightly during flexion may somewhat decrease active insufficiency of biceps brachii. However, this technique may not ideally emphasize biceps' involvement, since this position prevents body from achieving a more upright position at end of movement at any given initial body angle, thereby creating a peak contraction (greatest resistance at top of movement) on elbow flexors which enter into yet another related compromised mechanical position (see Tension Potential and Muscle Length-tension Relationship ). This exercise can be performed on TRXⓇ style suspension trainer or adjustable length gymnastics rings. See Gravity Vectors for greater understanding of how body angle influences resistance.",

Take care to maintain tension on suspension trainer near top of movement. Dismounting can be achieved by walking backward until body is upright or stepping out at top of movement. This exercise can be performed on TRXⓇ style suspension trainer or adjustable length gymnastics rings. This movement may involve more shoulder girdle retraction compared to traditional rotator cuff exercises such as Cable Shoulder External Rotation , where movement is purely shoulder external rotation. However, this movement can be performed more 'strict' if desired to minimize shoulder girdle movement. Similarly, traditional shoulder external rotator work calls for strict 90º elbow positioning. In this exercise utilizing bodyweight, elbow angle could be decreased in order to offer appropriate (lighter) starting resistance. In any case, attempt to keep elbow angle fixed throughout movement.",

Execution Pull hips back while flexing spine in C shape. Raise hips up high by straightening spine and hips until straight. Repeat.",
    "Comments": "This exercise can be performed on TRXⓇ style suspension trainer. See Suspended Supine Feet Mount/Dismount . Abdominals are exercised during spinal flexion when pulling suspension trainer back with head facing down . Erector Spinae is exercised during spinal extension when pushing suspension trainer forward with head facing up. As body is positioned further back greater emphaisis is placed on muscles responsible for pulling back and less emphasis is placed on muscles responsible for pushing forward.

    "Comments": "Both arms should be horizontal and straight. This movement arguably involves more hip internal rotation and transverse adduction than spinal rotation . Although it is considered oblique movement, remarkably little rotation actually occurs through spine, although rotators of spine act largely as stabilizers except at very beginning and end of motion where resistance from cable is minimal. A large part of rotational force actually occurs through rotation/transverse adduction of forward hip. Because rear leg is only supported by forefoot, hip of forward leg is utilized much greater than hip of rear leg since forward leg offers more secured base of support. Continued rotation would occur through spine except when cable makes contact with body precluding further movement and resistance would no longer be provided through cable since line of force is no longer perpendicular line of pull. Seated oblique exercises or those exercises where hips are stabilized allow for greater range of movement through spine. See Spot Reduction Myth .",

Stand with feet apart with each foot equal distance from landmine. Orientate foot and leg nearest to bar about 45 degrees toward (under) bar. Bend legs and raise heel of opposite leg (rear leg) so forefoot remains on floor. Execution Move end of barbell upward, across, and downward to opposite side while shifting stance to opposite orientation by pivoting on forefeet and planting new forward foot. Immediately return to opposite side in same pattern and repeat.",
    "Comments": "Keep back straight when lifting end of barbell from floor. After becoming familiar with exercise, progressively increase speed of movement. Switch hand placement each set, so opposite hand is near end of barbell. Both spinal rotation and hip rotation contribute to body's rotation. Because rear leg is only supported by forefoot, hip of forward leg is utilized (hip external rotation / transverse abduction) much greater than hip of rear leg, since forward leg offers more secured base of support. A small amount of hip and spinal extension occur in movement, but these forces primarily stabilize. Exercise may also be performed with barbell positioned into corner without lever gadget, however, facility managers may have legitimate concern about potential wear and tear on floor boards."

    "Comments": "Target muscle is exercised isometrically . Throughout lift, keep hips low, shoulders high, arms and back straight. Knees should point same direction as feet throughout movement. Keep bar close to body to improve mechanical lev erage. Grip strength and strength endurance often limit ability to perform multiple reps at heavy resistances. Gym chalk, wrist straps, grip work, and mixed grip can be used to enhance grip. Mixed grip indicates one hand holding with overhand grip and other hand holding with underhand grip. Lever barbell jack can be used to lift barbell from floor for easier loading and unload of weight plates. In powerlifting, do not squat down too deep and keep shoulder joint slightly behind bar for optimal leverage and mechanics (think 'teeter toter'). Upper body will move back as weight is pulled upward. On rep training, do not merely tap weight to ground, but instead, let barbell settle to ground each rep to sufficiently train range of motion through initial slack of heavy barbell. Heavy barbell deadlifts significantly engage Latissmus Dorsi . See Deadlift under Gluteus Maximus. Also see Deadlift Analysis and Deadlift Strength Standards .",

Balance on one leg while raising foot from behind and slipping single foot in loop(s). Release handle with hand and position leg back so it is supported behind body by suspension trainer. Place hands on hips and maintain balance throughout exercise. Execution Squat down by flexing knee and hip of front leg until knee of rear leg is almost in contact with floor. Return to original standing position by extending hip and knee of forward leg and repeat. Continue with opposite leg.",
    "Comments": "Keep torso upright during squat; flexible hip flexors are important. Forward knee should point same direction as foot throughout movement. Exercise can be dismounted by lifting suspended rear foot from loop, allowing it to fall back while placing foot on floor. A training partner can assist with positioning of loop around rear foot. May also be referred to as Suspended Single Leg Split Squat or Suspended Bulgarian Squat. This exercise can be performed on TRXⓇ style suspension trainer. Weighted versions of this exercise would normally be considered auxiliary in context of other basic exercises (ie: Barbell Squat, Sled Leg Press). However, in the context of suspension training only program, this exercise can be considered basic. Easier For those that lack sufficient leg strength, squat down part way as far as able. For those with inadequate balance, consider either placing foot on stationary object such as bench or placing hand on stationary object for support. Harder",

Gluteus Maximus will be activated as stabilizer on heavier loads when participant pushes stationary foot onto floor thereby anchoring lower body as hip adductors keep thighs together. Upper body muscles can also assist in keeping thigh of exercising leg along side stationary leg. Exercise name is somewhat counter-intuitive since direction of rotation is relative to movement of hip, or thigh, not bent leg. For example, in this exercises, external rotation of hip causes front of thigh to turn outward despite bent leg moving inward.

Keep bar over top of feet, close to legs. Do not pause or bounce at bottom of lift. Do not lower weight beyond mild stretch throughout hamstrings and low back. Full range of motion will vary from person to person. Choose platform height that allows contact with floor with slight stretch or set to height that allows bar to be lowered only millimeters from floor during warm up. This small reserve allows additional room to accommodate the hips loosen up and the grip to give slightly, but not so much that would increase risk of descending too far down, beyond a slight stretch. Those with less flexibility may not need to stand on platform. When finished with set, dismount by lowering weight with knees bent and low back straight. See Dangerous Exercise Essay .

Dorsal flexion of ankle reduces active insufficiency of Gastrocnemius allowing it to assist in knee flexion. Similar exercise can also be performed on some multi-hip machines and certain leg extension machines . Also see Bent-over Leg Curl .",

    "Instructions": "Preparation Place elevated platform in front of glute-hamstring apparatus. Adjust padded supports and kneel upright in apparatus.

Execution Lower body with hips straight by slowly straightening knees. Position hands forward, ready to push body weight back up off of surface.

    "Comments": "To keep exercise challenging, push off only hard enough to minimally assist raising of body with hamstrings only. Place hands on top of platform when controlled descent can no longer be maintained with hamstring strength alone. This movement emphasizes the short head of biceps femoris and other knee flexors listed since keeping hips nearly straight throughout movement causes active insufficiency in other three heads of hamstring, especially when moving toward fully upright position. This occurs because these biarticular muscles are simultaneously shortened at both the hip and knee joints thereby reducing their tension potential . In contrast, dorsal flexion of ankle reduces active insufficiency of Gastrocnemius allowing it to assist in knee flexion .
